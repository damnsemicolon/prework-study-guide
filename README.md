# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This web application "Prework Study Guide" was created by following the front-end developer boot camp's Prework Guide. It contains introductions to Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a beginner, everything looks elvish to me. Luckily with the help of Google and a huge dose of confidence from my tutor Sachin Jhaveri, I've manage to come to this step.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
